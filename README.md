Site about a mountain and a national park in my vicinity.
I made it as a tribute, and as a way to learn GSAP ScrollMagic plugin.

* I coded it to look similar to this design [link]: https://dribbble.com/shots/4542804-Greaterphoto-landing

* Found adequate image for animation and processed it in Adobe Photoshop

* Added GSAP which is animation library, so I can use their ScrollMagic plugin.

* Scroll Magic a scroll interaction library.

* With it you can easily react to the user's current scroll position.
  
## It's the perfect library for you, if you want to ...

* animate based on scroll position – either trigger an animation or synchronize it to the scrollbar movement (like a playback scrub control).
* pin an element starting at a specific scroll position – either indefinitely or for a limited amount of scroll progress (sticky elements).
* toggle CSS classes of elements on and off based on scroll position.
* effortlessly add parallax effects to your website.
* create an infinitely scrolling page (ajax load of additional content).
* dd callbacks at specific scroll positions or while scrolling past a specific section, passing a progress parameter.

## All in all, this was a very fun and educational project, it made me realize how huge and helpful GSAP is,

## and it's potential in web development.
